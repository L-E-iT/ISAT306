# ISAT306 
This repo will host Python and Arduino sketches for ISAT 306 at JMU, Spring 2016.
The code contained here is to support the semester project involving using a water flow meter
and CT to measure water and electrical usage. The project's goal is to create
a cheap water and electrical meter with a web-page frontend and a mobile app
that shows the user usage statistics for different properties.
